A multicolored patchwork of fields from this false color Landsat 5 image from eastern Washington.  

Rivers interrupt the regular tessellation created by the farm fields.  Uncultivated land in the upper left side of the image is also visible.

Circular center-pivot irrigation fields also exist.
